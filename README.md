## 💌 Contact Form

A minimal contact form (newsletter-style) is included in the footer:
- Users can enter their **email** and **message**
- On submit, their **email client opens** with message pre-filled
- No backend required — easy and fast for them to reach out!

## ⏳ Preloader

A glowing neon **creative preloader** appears when the page loads, enhancing the user experience and keeping the site engaging.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Make sure you have all the image assets and fonts linked correctly.
3. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser — and enjoy!

No build tools, frameworks, or external dependencies required — it's a fully static and lightweight portfolio.
